% HANDLES = RECURSE_HANDLES(COMMON);
%   Creates a nested structure of function handles. The nested
%   hierarchy emulates the COMMON input variable exactly. This is meant to
%   allow the user to call functions nested within this structure without actually
%   needing to change directories or the MATLAB path.

%   Originally, the fhandle approach below was unneccesary

handles = [];

% I don't see any way to do this except the slow recursive way :(
