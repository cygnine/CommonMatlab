                            1.) License
________________________________________________________________________________

These Matlab files are released under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file in
this directory.

Basically do what you want, and don't sue me. And give me credit if any is due.

                            2.) Setup
________________________________________________________________________________

This is a collection of tools for use regarding other Matlab packages (e.g.
Speclab). In itself it is just a collection of perhaps-useful files. The file
setup.m will run through all subdirectories found and if a "handles__.m" file
exists in the subdirectory, it will run through all m-files found in that
subdirectory and add them as function handles to a matlab-global variable called
"handles". The handles__.m file in each subdirectory also specifies which
subdirectories of that subdirectory are to be traversed. 

You may just run 
>> setup;
at the command line, and it will perform the necessary operations. The common
subdirectory contains some m-files that might be useful for programming in
Matlab in general.

                            3.) Intended audience
________________________________________________________________________________

This module is for use primarily in tandem with another of my released modules,
e.g. Speclab. It is not really meant to be stand-alone.

                            4.) Development history
________________________________________________________________________________

If you'd like the whole development history for this collection, you'll need the
open-source "distributed version control system" called "git". 

You can clone the repo with the command:
git clone git://github.com/cygnine/CommonMatlab.git

You may navigate a web browser to http://www.github.com/cygnine/CommonMatlab and
github will show a pretty GUI of the development history and included files.
You can also download a tarball directly from github of each repo, but the
tarball won't have the history.
